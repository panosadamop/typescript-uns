    <h1>TypeScript TSD and DefinitelyTyped</h1>
    <h2>DefinitelyTyped is a huge community project to type existing NPM packages and improve type re-use. Instead of having to write definitions yourself for the 1400 packages typed in DefinitelyTyped, you can just copy and paste them into your own project.<br><br>There's also a tool called TSD which allows you to install from DefinitelyTyped. Using `tsd install node --save` would install `node/node.d.ts` from DefinitelyTyped, and write the commit to a file called `tsd.json`.</h2>

Theoretically, everything in DefinitelyTyped is a subset of Typings.</h2>
