	<h1>TypeScript Definitions</h1>
	<h2>TypeScript provides a way of writing declarations. These are <span class="remark">`.d.ts` </span>files, and they can be emitted by the TypeScript compiler alongside JavaScript files. <br><br><strong>This provides a mechanism for JavaScript and the TypeScript type system to be separated. </strong><br><br>This is a huge benefit for developers, as it allows the community to provide type definitions for existing JavaScript that can then be consumed in a type safe manner and it allows to publish TypeScript as JavaScript with an opt-in type system for fellow TypeScript developers to consume safely.</h2>
